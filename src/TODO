[ Client DLL ]
There's still loads of work to be done to make this a fully fledged Bittorrent Client. I've divided the work into three sections (for the moment). Features to be added, features to be improved and sections of code that need rearchitecting. I've also put a difficulty estimation for anyone interested in picking an item and completing it.

-- FEATURES TO BE ADDED --
    01) HTTP Seeding - The ability to use a normal HTTP/FTP download as a "seed". [MEDIUM-HIGH]
    02) Connection Encryption - The ability to encrypt connections between compliant peers. [MEDIUM]
    03) Implement the "fast peers" extensions. [MEDIUM-LOW]
    04) Implement DHT/Peer Exchange. [MEDIUM-LOW]
    07) Recording who sends bad chunks and dropping them after they send X chunks. [LOW]
    08) Add in uPnP to the engine to allow automatic port forwarding [integrating it [EASY], writing it [HARD]]
    10) Choking and Optimistic Unchoking algorithm needed. [MEDIUM]
    11) Anti-snubbing needs to be implemented [MEDIUM]
    14) Support SOCKS proxies
    15) Automagic updates of the client - similar to azureus ideally
    17) Put in more NUnit tests... i got lazy when it came to tests :p
    19) FileSystemWatcher: AutoDownload .torrents in this directory
    24) Update the rest of the Events to make sure they're all ok [ LOW - needs docs to explain safe usage too ]
    25) Implement End Game Mode. This is a priority [LOW]
    26) Internally count every time i try to connect to a peer. If it gets high, dump the peer. There are cases where i just keep connecting and then they dump the connection... hundreds of times in a row
    27) Why are some peers disconnecting me after i send request messages? It's happening too frequently to be coincidence. Mark what client is doing this.
    28) Investigate why i appear to be being banned/dropped by certain peers and with others i can happily request 100's of pieces without a problem

-- FEATURES TO BE IMPROVED --
    01) Allow editing of .torrent information EXCEPT for the infohash section [MEDIUM]
    02) Support cancel messages [MEDIUM-LOW]
    05) New super seeding algorithm. At the moment defaults to "seeding" which defaults to "downloading. [LOW]
    06) End Game mode should be implemented [MEDIUM]
    11) Use PieceEventArgs properly [LOW]
    12) Use a MemoryBuffer/DiskCache to avoid constant read/writes to the disk [MEDIUM-HIGH]
    12) Fix the "negative download speed bug". This is a side effect of the above design choice. Should go away when 11 is completed. [LOW] [ COMPLETE ]
    13) Implement "PeerID" to link a peer with the client they're running [LOW]
    17) use the PeerID class [LOW]
    18) Custom attributes for .torrent files
    19) Fix global upload/download speed. Make it follow the settings [LOW] [ FIXED FOR PER TORRENT LIMITS ]
    20) Count HashFails internally [LOW]
    21) Support IPV6
    26) There are cases where closing the library returns a null WaitHandle causing a crash. Find out why.
    27) Fix Start/Stop/Pause again
    28) Remove BEncode.Decode() and PeerWireEncoder.Decode() and change to static methods IBEncodedValue.Decode() and IPeerMessage.Decode() which makes more sense
    29) Implement the new mechanism for catching bad peers and resuming pieces where the inital peer stops sending pieces. Just like i talked about in the utorrent forum
    30) Put peers that i can connect to but drop the connection in a seperate "busy" list instead of dropping them completely.
    31) After receiving X number of pieces from a peer, reduce their FailedConnectionAttempts value as they are "good"
    32) Make the queuing up of new request messages less dependant on the timer. Possibly queue up messages as a result of receibing an UnChoke message, and every time i receive a PieceMessage i should check if i need to enqueue a new Request message.
    33) Make message sending less dependant on the timer. Whenever i queue up a message i should check if i can send it right then. Like for ratelimiting
If anyone finds bugs or anything in the code (which i'm sure there are many :p) feel free to drop me an email. For the moment i don't want people commiting patches directly to SVN, i'd like to see them first. But if you want to fix a bug, please go right ahead and write the code. The only request i have is to do your best to match my coding style. There's nothing worse than having several different coding styles in the same class.

[ Tracker DLL ]

-- FEATURES TO BE ADDED --
    01) Use Asynchronous IO where possible and useful
    02) Implement some events for the gui
    03) Add some stats to Asp.Net frontend
    04) Add http torrent upload to Asp.Net frontend
    05) Refactor identification of Peers into a seperate class and use that for indexing in dictionaries
    06) Integrate the Tracker into the GUI 
    06.1) Add Torrent Generation to the GUI
    07) Add some events to the tracker so the gui can display some stats
    08) Change the backend to use the event form 07
    09) Add in support for NAT-Checking (checking if peers are connectable). If they aren't, send em a warning message
	

-- FEATURES TO BE IMPROVED --
    01) Asp.Net Frontend needs to be improved
    02) Test Asp.Net Frontend with mod_mono
    03) Improve doc
